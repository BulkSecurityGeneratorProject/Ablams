Audiobook listen and Managment Software

this piece of software was created because i was in some ways unsatisfied with the existing open source alternatives.
i felt that there was a lack of features that i really wanted.
These are especially 
* keeping track of your progress through the books
* syncing the progress between multiple devices to allow a seemless switch of the playing device
* grouping multiple audiobooks which relate in some way to each other (same world, prequels, sequels)

This project still needs huge work and is nowhere near production ready.
With this project i deepen my knowlegde and trying new things out, so the architecture and code is not polished and still evolving.

Maybe this software will some day reach production, but it will not be tomorrow. ;)
